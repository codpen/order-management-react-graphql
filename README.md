## Why does it exist?

The main motivation is to provide a codebase for an order management system that **you can build** on top of.

> This project was built with a main focus as a support software for a company that prints PVC banners etc. Thats the reason why you might find some business specific pieces of code. The company is based in Czechia, thats also the reason why the default currency is CZK and there are Czech translations.
