## Why does it exist?

The main motivation is to provide a codebase for an order management system that **you can build on top of**.

> This project was built with a main focus as a support software for a company that prints PVC banners etc. Thats the reason why you might find some business specific pieces of code. The company is based in Czechia 🇨🇿, thats also the reason why the default currency is CZK and there are Czech translations.

> Also this project is a result of my masters thesis on the University of Economics in 2020 👨‍🎓
